                    <p>If people suddenly begin to migrate in masses from their countries to the ones where the climate change hasn’t yet bringed its negative effects, we’ll assist to an huge increment of the poor classes and to dramatic racial conflicts.
                    </p>
                    <p>Scientists predict migration will grow as the planet gets hotter. Over the next 30 years, 143 million people are likely to be uprooted by rising seas, drought, searing temperatures and other climate catastrophes, according to the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report published this year.</p>
                <p>If Global Warming’s negative effects happens to affect a country far enough from ours, it doesn’t mean that we aren’t involved in the problem. We are, directly, since the moment that the people of that countries may probably come to our place.<mark><a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/climate-change-is-already-fueling-global-migration-the-world-isnt-ready-to-meet-peoples-needs-experts-say#:~:text=And%20scientists%20predict%20migration%20will,Change%20report%20published%20this%20year.">PBS.org</a></mark><---more info here!</p>

                    <p>If the bering sea would melt down, a new channel of communication will open between Russia and USA.</p>

                    <p>There are many implications on the economic side, but we will take one example for all of the macro-economics issues that climate change involves.
                Imagine the Bering Sea melted down, forever. First, it would be a new, persistent channel for communications and shipping between Russia and USA. Then, that part of Russia (Siberia) would be warmer and warmer and suitable for living and visiting, meaning that it will begin to attract more and more interests worldwide.
                Other countries, in the other hand, may be too hardly damaged from the change.<mark><a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/science/climate-issues/ocean-impacts#:~:text=Today%2C%20the%20ocean%20has%20absorbed,marine%20heatwaves%2C%20and%20ocean%20acidification.">UN.org</a></mark><---more info here!</p>

                <h2>How it's affecting the Earth's climate.</h2>
                <p>Earth's climate has changed throughout history. Just in the last 800,000 years, there have been eight cycles of ice ages and warmer periods, with the end of the last ice age about 11,700 years ago marking the beginning of the modern climate era — and of human civilization. Most of these climate changes are attributed to very small variations in Earth’s orbit that change the amount of solar energy our planet receives.</p>    
                <p>The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid-1800s, and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun’s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere, ocean, and land, and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred.</p>
                <p>Ice cores drawn from Greenland, Antarctica, and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth’s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings, ocean sediments, coral reefs, and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient, or paleoclimate, evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.   <mark><a href="https://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx">PEPNW.org</a></mark><---more info here!</p>
